## CALLING SPECIALIZED AGENTS

If a task needs a specialist you can't handle alone, update `.agent_role`:

```bash
# Switch to a specialist for specific work
echo "devops-engineer" > .agent_role
git add .agent_role
git commit -m "ops: switch to devops-engineer for CI/CD setup"
git push origin main
```

After switching, the next iteration will load that agent's expertise.

**Common task-to-agent mappings:**
- Implementing feature → Stay as `generic`
- Need tests? → Switch to `qa-specialist`
- Ready to release? → Switch to `release-manager`
- Need better docs? → Switch to `documentation-specialist`
- Complex multi-part work? → Switch to `project-orchestrator`
- Setting up CI/CD? → Switch to `devops-engineer`

Switch back to `generic` when the specialist work is done.

---

**Now start: Check `.agent_role` and read TASKS.md**

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL TOKEN CONSTRAINTS:
- Iteration: 30 / 64k Token Budget
- Attempt: 3 (previous attempts may have partial progress)
- **Mandate:** Operate efficiently. Use partial edits, not full file rewrites when possible.
- **Output:** Be concise and action-oriented.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 30)

```
# invoice-resolver-ai
**Mission:** **Startup Idea: Invoiced – Autonomous Invoice Dispute Resolver for Freelancers & Micro-SaaS**

**Problem:** Freelancers and small SaaS founders waste hours chasing unpaid invoices, drafting dispute letters, and navigating payment platforms. Payment delays and chargebacks are common, but resolution is manual and frustrating.

**Solution:** An AI agent that monitors Stripe/PayPal/Bank feeds, detects overdue or disputed invoices, and automatically:
- Sends polite follow-ups with payment links
- Drafts formal dispute letters (with evidence attachments) for chargebacks
- Escalates to small claims paperwork if needed (pre-filled forms)
- Learns which templates and timing work best (A/B test)

**Tech Stack:** Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Celery, Stripe/PayPal/Bank APIs (Plaid), OpenAI/Claude for letter drafting, PDF generation (WeasyPrint or ReportLab), optional web dashboard (Streamlit).

**Monetization:** Freemium – free for up to 5 invoices/month, then $19/mo for unlimited + AI dispute drafting. Add-ons: legal template packs, multi-currency support.

**Why Wiggum can build it:** Clear tasks (scrapers, API integrations, email automation, PDF generation, simple ML for timing optimization). Well-defined data model. Can launch MVP in a week. Sells to a huge market (independent creators, indie hackers).

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Design complete database schema (PostgreSQL) for users, invoices, templates, campaigns, payment connections, and A/B test results. Create ER diagram and write migration SQL.
  - *Deliverable:* `schema.sql` with tables: users (subscription_tier, invoice_limit), invoices (status, due_date, amount, stripe_payment_intent_id, paypal_txn_id, plaid_account_id), payment_connections (provider, credentials_encrypted, user_id), templates (type, content, variables), campaigns (template_id, sent_at, opened_at, paid_after), ab_tests (variant, metric, result).
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Initialize Python/FastAPI project structure with Poetry/pip, setup logging configuration, environment variable management (python-dotenv), and core settings module.
  - *Deliverable:* Project scaffold with `main.py`, `core/config.py`, `core/logger.py`, `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` including: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, pydantic, python-dotenv.
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Setup PostgreSQL database locally (docker-compose.yml) and implement SQLAlchemy models with Alembic migrations for the schema.
  - *Deliverable:* `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL service, `models.py` with all SQLAlchemy models, Alembic setup with initial migration.
- [x] **Task 1.4:** Create comprehensive API documentation outline and define OpenAPI specs for all endpoints to be built (authentication, invoice CRUD, webhook receivers, admin endpoints).
  - *Deliverable:* `docs/api.md` with endpoint list, request/response schemas, authentication flow (JWT), and webhook payload examples for Stripe/PayPal.

## Phase 2: Core Backend & Data Model
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Implement FastAPI user authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing (bcrypt), and subscription tier enforcement middleware (check invoice limits for freemium users).
  - *Deliverable:* `api/auth.py` with /register, /login, /refresh endpoints, `middleware.py` with SubscriptionLimitChecker, and protected route decorator.
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Build invoice management endpoints: create invoice (manual import), list invoices with filters (status, due_date range), update status (mark as paid/disputed), and soft delete. Integrate with database models.
  - *Deliverable:* `api/invoices.py` with CRUD operations, Pydantic schemas for InvoiceCreate/Update/Response, and integration tests using pytest.
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Implement webhook receivers for Stripe (invoice.payment_failed, charge.dispute.created) and PayPal (PAYMENT.DENIED, DISPUTE.CREATED) to automatically update invoice status in database.
  - *Deliverable:* `api/webhooks.py` with signature verification for Stripe (webhook secret) and PayPal (transmission ID + secret), endpoint at /webhooks/{provider}, event handler functions that update invoice records and trigger Celery tasks.
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Setup Celery with Redis broker, create worker processes, and implement background task for invoice status synchronization (periodic polling as fallback if webhooks fail).
  - *Deliverable:* `celery_app.py` configured with Redis, `tasks/sync.py` with periodic task (every 15 min) that queries Stripe/PayPal APIs for invoice status updates, and worker startup script.

## Phase 3: Integrations & AI Features
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Implement payment provider integration layer: Stripe API client (stripe-python) for retrieving invoices, payment intents, and customers; PayPal API client (paypalrestsdk) for txns and disputes; Plaid integration for bank feed linking (link token creation, transactions sync).
  - *Deliverable:* `integrations/stripe_client.py`, `integrations/paypal_client.py`, `integrations/plaid_client.py` with functions: connect_account, get_invoice_status, list_transactions, and error handling.
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Build email automation system using SendGrid or SMTP (smtplib) with template rendering (Jinja2). Create follow-up sequences: 3-day reminder, 7-day late notice, 14-day final notice before dispute.
  - *Deliverable:* `email/sender.py` with send_followup_email(invoice, template_type), `email/templates/` directory with HTML templates for each follow-up stage, and queue system using Celery for scheduled sends.
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Integrate AI letter drafting using OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude. Create prompts for formal dispute letters that include invoice details, payment evidence (dates, amounts, communication logs), and legal references (small claims requirements).
  - *Deliverable:* `ai/dispute_drafter.py` with function draft_dispute_letter(invoice, evidence_list) that calls OpenAI API with structured prompt, returns LaTeX or HTML letter content, and includes cost tracking.
- [ ] **Task 3.4:** Implement PDF generation for dispute letters and small claims forms using WeasyPrint (HTML->PDF) or ReportLab. Create templates for common small claims forms (pre-filled with user/business info).
  - *Deliverable:* `pdf/generator.py` with generate_pdf(html_content, output_path) using WeasyPrint, `pdf/templates/` directory with base letter template and small claims form template, and storage to S3 or local filesystem.

## Phase 4: Dashboard & Analytics
- [ ] **Task 4.1:** Build Streamlit dashboard for users to view invoice status, payment connections, campaign metrics, and AI letter drafts. Include authentication with JWT and real-time updates via FastAPI endpoints.
  - *Deliverable:* `dashboard/app.py` with pages: Overview (KPIs: overdue count, recovery rate), Invoices (table with filters), Campaigns (A/B test results), Settings (payment connections). Uses streamlit-authenticator for login.
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Implement A/B testing framework for follow-up templates and timing. Store template variants and send times, track opens (pixel tracking) and payments after send, calculate conversion rates.
  - *Deliverable:* `ab_testing/experiment.py` with ABTest model, assign_variant(user_id, test_name) function, tracking endpoints for email opens (/track/open/<campaign_id>), and analysis query to report winning variants.
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Create admin panel (FastAPI + simple HTML/JS or separate Streamlit page) for viewing all users, system health (Celery workers, API latency), and managing subscription tiers.
  - *Deliverable:* `admin/` directory with FastAPI routes under /admin/* (require admin role), dashboard showing user count, active connections, recent webhook events, and form to upgrade/downgrade users.
- [ ] **Task 4.4:** Implement billing integration with Stripe Billing or Paddle for subscription management. Create plans: Free (5 invoices/month), Pro ($19/mo unlimited), add-ons ($5 legal pack, $3 multi-currency). Webhook to handle subscription updates.
  - *Deliverable:* `billing/stripe_billing.py` with create_checkout_session(user, plan_id), webhook handler for customer.subscription.updated/deleted to update user.subscription_tier in DB, and plan definitions in FastAPI config.

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Optional Bonus)
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Write comprehensive test suite with pytest: unit tests for all services (email, AI, PDF), integration tests for API endpoints using TestClient, and mocked external API tests (Stripe/PayPal/OpenAI).
  - *Deliverable:* `tests/` directory with >80% coverage, `pytest.ini` configured, fixtures for database and mock clients, CI GitHub Actions workflow running tests on push.
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Containerize application with Docker multi-stage build: separate images for FastAPI, Celery worker, Redis, PostgreSQL. Create docker-compose.prod.yml for deployment with secrets management.
  - *Deliverable:* `Dockerfile` for API, `Dockerfile.celery` for worker, `docker-compose.prod.yml` with all services, healthchecks, and volume mounts for logs/media.
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Deploy to cloud (Heroku, Fly.io, or AWS) with SSL, automated backups (PostgreSQL), monitoring (Sentry for errors, Prometheus metrics), and CI/CD pipeline.
  - *Deliverable:* Deployment script (`deploy.sh`) or GitHub Actions workflow, sentry config, metrics endpoint at /metrics, and runbook for backup/restore procedures.
```

# invoice-resolver-ai
**Mission:** **Startup Idea: Invoiced – Autonomous Invoice Dispute Resolver for Freelancers & Micro-SaaS**

**Problem:** Freelancers and small SaaS founders waste hours chasing unpaid invoices, drafting dispute letters, and navigating payment platforms. Payment delays and chargebacks are common, but resolution is manual and frustrating.

**Solution:** An AI agent that monitors Stripe/PayPal/Bank feeds, detects overdue or disputed invoices, and automatically:
- Sends polite follow-ups with payment links
- Drafts formal dispute letters (with evidence attachments) for chargebacks
- Escalates to small claims paperwork if needed (pre-filled forms)
- Learns which templates and timing work best (A/B test)

**Tech Stack:** Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Celery, Stripe/PayPal/Bank APIs (Plaid), OpenAI/Claude for letter drafting, PDF generation (WeasyPrint or ReportLab), optional web dashboard (Streamlit).

**Monetization:** Freemium – free for up to 5 invoices/month, then $19/mo for unlimited + AI dispute drafting. Add-ons: legal template packs, multi-currency support.

**Why Wiggum can build it:** Clear tasks (scrapers, API integrations, email automation, PDF generation, simple ML for timing optimization). Well-defined data model. Can launch MVP in a week. Sells to a huge market (independent creators, indie hackers).

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Design complete database schema (PostgreSQL) for users, invoices, templates, campaigns, payment connections, and A/B test results. Create ER diagram and write migration SQL.
  - *Deliverable:* `schema.sql` with tables: users (subscription_tier, invoice_limit), invoices (status, due_date, amount, stripe_payment_intent_id, paypal_txn_id, plaid_account_id), payment_connections (provider, credentials_encrypted, user_id), templates (type, content, variables), campaigns (template_id, sent_at, opened_at, paid_after), ab_tests (variant, metric, result).
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Initialize Python/FastAPI project structure with Poetry/pip, setup logging configuration, environment variable management (python-dotenv), and core settings module.
  - *Deliverable:* Project scaffold with `main.py`, `core/config.py`, `core/logger.py`, `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` including: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, pydantic, python-dotenv.
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Setup PostgreSQL database locally (docker-compose.yml) and implement SQLAlchemy models with Alembic migrations for the schema.
  - *Deliverable:* `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL service, `models.py` with all SQLAlchemy models, Alembic setup with initial migration.
- [x] **Task 1.4:** Create comprehensive API documentation outline and define OpenAPI specs for all endpoints to be built (authentication, invoice CRUD, webhook receivers, admin endpoints).
  - *Deliverable:* `docs/api.md` with endpoint list, request/response schemas, authentication flow (JWT), and webhook payload examples for Stripe/PayPal.

## Phase 2: Core Backend & Data Model
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Implement FastAPI user authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing (bcrypt), and subscription tier enforcement middleware (check invoice limits for freemium users).
  - *Deliverable:* `api/auth.py` with /register, /login, /refresh endpoints, `middleware.py` with SubscriptionLimitChecker, and protected route decorator.
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Build invoice management endpoints: create invoice (manual import), list invoices with filters (status, due_date range), update status (mark as paid/disputed), and soft delete. Integrate with database models.
  - *Deliverable:* `api/invoices.py` with CRUD operations, Pydantic schemas for InvoiceCreate/Update/Response, and integration tests using pytest.
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Implement webhook receivers for Stripe (invoice.payment_failed, charge.dispute.created) and PayPal (PAYMENT.DENIED, DISPUTE.CREATED) to automatically update invoice status in database.
  - *Deliverable:* `api/webhooks.py` with signature verification for Stripe (webhook secret) and PayPal (transmission ID + secret), endpoint at /webhooks/{provider}, event handler functions that update invoice records and trigger Celery tasks.
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Setup Celery with Redis broker, create worker processes, and implement background task for invoice status synchronization (periodic polling as fallback if webhooks fail).
  - *Deliverable:* `celery_app.py` configured with Redis, `tasks/sync.py` with periodic task (every 15 min) that queries Stripe/PayPal APIs for invoice status updates, and worker startup script.

## Phase 3: Integrations & AI Features
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Implement payment provider integration layer: Stripe API client (stripe-python) for retrieving invoices, payment intents, and customers; PayPal API client (paypalrestsdk) for txns and disputes; Plaid integration for bank feed linking (link token creation, transactions sync).
  - *Deliverable:* `integrations/stripe_client.py`, `integrations/paypal_client.py`, `integrations/plaid_client.py` with functions: connect_account, get_invoice_status, list_transactions, and error handling.
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Build email automation system using SendGrid or SMTP (smtplib) with template rendering (Jinja2). Create follow-up sequences: 3-day reminder, 7-day late notice, 14-day final notice before dispute.
  - *Deliverable:* `email/sender.py` with send_followup_email(invoice, template_type), `email/templates/` directory with HTML templates for each follow-up stage, and queue system using Celery for scheduled sends.
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Integrate AI letter drafting using OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude. Create prompts for formal dispute letters that include invoice details, payment evidence (dates, amounts, communication logs), and legal references (small claims requirements).
  - *Deliverable:* `ai/dispute_drafter.py` with function draft_dispute_letter(invoice, evidence_list) that calls OpenAI API with structured prompt, returns LaTeX or HTML letter content, and includes cost tracking.
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Implement PDF generation for dispute letters and small claims forms using WeasyPrint (HTML->PDF) or ReportLab. Create templates for common small claims forms (pre-filled with user/business info).
  - *Deliverable:* `pdf/generator.py` with generate_pdf(html_content, output_path) using WeasyPrint, `pdf/templates/` directory with base letter template and small claims form template, and storage to S3 or local filesystem.

## Phase 4: Dashboard & Analytics
- [ ] **Task 4.1:** Build Streamlit dashboard for users to view invoice status, payment connections, campaign metrics, and AI letter drafts. Include authentication with JWT and real-time updates via FastAPI endpoints.
  - *Deliverable:* `dashboard/app.py` with pages: Overview (KPIs: overdue count, recovery rate), Invoices (table with filters), Campaigns (A/B test results), Settings (payment connections). Uses streamlit-authenticator for login.
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Implement A/B testing framework for follow-up templates and timing. Store template variants and send times, track opens (pixel tracking) and payments after send, calculate conversion rates.
  - *Deliverable:* `ab_testing/experiment.py` with ABTest model, assign_variant(user_id, test_name) function, tracking endpoints for email opens (/track/open/<campaign_id>), and analysis query to report winning variants.
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Create admin panel (FastAPI + simple HTML/JS or separate Streamlit page) for viewing all users, system health (Celery workers, API latency), and managing subscription tiers.
  - *Deliverable:* `admin/` directory with FastAPI routes under /admin/* (require admin role), dashboard showing user count, active connections, recent webhook events, and form to upgrade/downgrade users.
- [ ] **Task 4.4:** Implement billing integration with Stripe Billing or Paddle for subscription management. Create plans: Free (5 invoices/month), Pro ($19/mo unlimited), add-ons ($5 legal pack, $3 multi-currency). Webhook to handle subscription updates.
  - *Deliverable:* `billing/stripe_billing.py` with create_checkout_session(user, plan_id), webhook handler for customer.subscription.updated/deleted to update user.subscription_tier in DB, and plan definitions in FastAPI config.

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Optional Bonus)
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Write comprehensive test suite with pytest: unit tests for all services (email, AI, PDF), integration tests for API endpoints using TestClient, and mocked external API tests (Stripe/PayPal/OpenAI).
  - *Deliverable:* `tests/` directory with >80% coverage, `pytest.ini` configured, fixtures for database and mock clients, CI GitHub Actions workflow running tests on push.
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Containerize application with Docker multi-stage build: separate images for FastAPI, Celery worker, Redis, PostgreSQL. Create docker-compose.prod.yml for deployment with secrets management.
  - *Deliverable:* `Dockerfile` for API, `Dockerfile.celery` for worker, `docker-compose.prod.yml` with all services, healthchecks, and volume mounts for logs/media.
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Deploy to cloud (Heroku, Fly.io, or AWS) with SSL, automated backups (PostgreSQL), monitoring (Sentry for errors, Prometheus metrics), and CI/CD pipeline.
  - *Deliverable:* Deployment script (`deploy.sh`) or GitHub Actions workflow, sentry config, metrics endpoint at /metrics, and runbook for backup/restore procedures.
